## Why Did I Create This?

Let's face it‚Äîapplying quickly to Upwork jobs was always a challenge. Other scheduling tools were often pricey. I thought, "Why pay when I can create my own solution?" So, here it is‚Äîmy very own backend scheduler. It's efficient, highly customizable, and best of all, it's free because I built it myself! üí™
## Features

- **Scheduled Task Execution**: Run tasks at regular intervals without breaking a sweat.
